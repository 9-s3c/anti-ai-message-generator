# anti-ai-message-generator

this project allows you to generate images that are less likely to be detected 
when violating tos on social media, it barely works and i personally have 
no use for it, but it was fun to create

just git clone it, then in a terminal cd to the directory and run "php -S 0.0.0.0:8888"
which will allow you to use this tool in a browser locally
